The UniTAO inventory system can be walked through using a single GET REST command:
SERVER/inventory/{type}         // Get list all available IDs for {type}
SERVER/inventory/{type}/{id}    // Get specific object ID of TYPE

For demo/testing data is uploaded from "dbSchemas/DynamoDB/Data.json". 
Feel free to add/modify records, data as well as schemas, as long as they are valid based on their corresponding type schema. 

Because schema is treated just like data (... it is UNIFIED), you can obtain a list of all 
available types, and the schema for them using the same API when you ask for {type} = "schema"
as in the following EXAMPLES:

SERVER/inventory/schema                // Get list all available object types-schemas

==> ["DC_admin_domain","DC_type","data_center","infrastructure","region","schema"]

SERVER/inventory/schema/data_center    // Get the data_denter schema

You can also traverse through the inventory relationships:

curl localhost:8002/inventory/infrastructure/global -s  | jq ".data.regions" 
[
  "North_America",
  "South_America",
  "Europe",
  "Asia",
  "Middle_East",
  "Africa"
]

Now fetch the North_America region::

curl localhost:8002/inventory/region/North_America -s  | jq ".data.data_centers" 
[
  "SEA1",
  "DFW4",
  "LAX2"
]

Now fetch the "SEA1" data center:

curl localhost:8002/inventory/data_center/SEA1 -s  | jq ".data" 
{
  "DC_type": "SFv7",
  "admin_domains": [
    "sec",
    "identity",
    "network",
    "apps",
    "services"
  ],
  "description": "Seattle Data Center 1",
  "id": "SEA1",
  "location": "US98052",
  "public_ipv4s": [
    "170.2.3.0/8",
    "168.12.3.84"
  ]
}
